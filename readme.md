# Mootools Scrollbar

An easily customizable scrollbar.

## Background

We needed custom scrollbars for several projects and couldn't find any that was 
really easy to use and compatible with Mootools 1.4.

We are realising this script as it could be useful for other developpers.

## Requirements

* Mootools 1.4
* Mootools-more Drag

## Get files

__Manual__

1. Download this: http://github.com/13i/scrollbar/zipball/master
2. Unzip that download.
3. Copy the resulting folder in `js` directory
4. Rename the folder you just copied to `scrollbar`

__GIT Submodule__

In your `js` directory type:

    git submodule add git://github.com/13i/scrollbar.git scrollbar
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

__GIT Clone__

In your `js` directory type:

    git clone git://github.com/13i/scrollbar.git scrollbar

## Installation

We assume you have already included `Mootools` & `Mootools/Drag` in your page.

In your `<HEAD>` :

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="JS_FOLDER/scrollbar/Source/scrollbar.css" />
    <script type="text/javascript" src="JS_FOLDER/scrollbar/Source/scrollbar.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    window.addEvent('domready', function(){
        new Scrollbar('myScrollbar');
    });
    </script>
    
In your `<BODY>` :

    <div id="myScrollbar" style="height:200px; overflow-y: auto;">
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
        <p>Lorem...</p>
    </div>
